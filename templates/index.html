    <h1>The Dark Energy Camera Legacy Survey</h1>
    <p>
    The Dark Energy Camera Legacy Survey is an ongoing public <a href="http://noao.edu/">NOAO</a> Survey Program to provide deeper, second-epoch imaging of the <a href="http://sdss.org/">SDSS</a> footprint in three optical bands. Using the <a href="http://www.ctio.noao.edu/noao/content/dark-energy-camera-decam">Dark Energy Camera</a> (DECam) at the prime focus of the 4m <a href="http://www.ctio.noao.edu/noao/content/Victor-Blanco-4-m-Telescope">Blanco telescope</a>, we will image 6700 deg<sup>2</sup> of the SDSS/BOSS extragalactic footprint that lies in the region -20 < Dec < +30 deg to depths of g = 24.7, r = 23.9, and z = 23.0 AB mag (5-sigma point-source). The goal is to create a high quality multicolor imaging dataset that will be significantly deeper and have better image quality than SDSS or <a href="http://pan-starrs.ifa.hawaii.edu/public/">Pan-STARRS</a>. Our survey will enable transformational studies of the dark and baryonic matter distribution in galaxy halos, focusing on the key issues of feedback and halo growth in the evolution of galaxies and AGN. The data will also be useful for studies of the halo and satellites of the Milky Way. In addition to providing a legacy dataset that will greatly enhance the value of the existing SDSS spectroscopy, our proposed survey will enable target selection within this footprint for the future <a href="http://desi.lbl.gov/">Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument</a> (DESI) survey, which aims to provide spectra of additional tens of millions of galaxies and QSOs.
